# Template gaps

Generated files are never edited by hand (AGENTS.md). When a field project needs something a
template can't do, add a row here and say what the application did instead. A unit that closes a
gap changes its Status.

| # | Gap | Found | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Multipart's status, list and complete can't carry the video's state; complete answers 200, not 202 | v3 (V3-13) | Open |
| 2 | A completion stopped by a failing hook fails the next start, with no reason | v3 (V3-13) | Open (PF06 logs the reason; PF08 keeps startup going) |
| 3 | The outbox relay retries a failing codec silently, for ever | v3 (V3-13) | Open: still retried for ever, now logged (PF06) |
| 4 | Lifecycle and Transcoder hooks get no key prefix | v3 (V3-13) | Open |
| 5 | A hook that throws while the Transcoder reports a failure stops the Transcoder | v3 (V3-14) | Open (PF08) |
| 6 | A stub's queue publisher can't name its message ID | v3 (V3-15) | Fixed in V3-18 |
| 7 | The cache read's 404 can't be shaped from its hooks | v3 (V3-15) | Open |
| 8 | The export serves no browser and has no place for one | v3 (V3-16) | Open; v3 edits four scaffold files instead. UI is outside Jeeves for now. |

## Known limits

Found in the 2026-11-12 review. Each is a fixed policy inside a template.

| Limit | Status |
| --- | --- |
| The cache read turns its cache off for the life of the process after one stalled cache call | Open (PF07) |
| The event counter keeps one receipt row per event for ever | Open |
| The outbox relay sends at most 10 rows about once a second | Open |
| A process that loses its broker exits and is not restarted | Open; a deployment's restart policy covers it |
| Host names are compiled into the export for local Compose | Open; deployment is outside Jeeves |
